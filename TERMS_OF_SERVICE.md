## Limitation of Liability

**Short version**: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service;

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.
